# Controls

With this project I intend to learn tailwindcss and to create complex controls which are usable in other projects. 
These controls can be used in other projects. This project is created as a react app so it's not a react library that you can install for using the controls in this project. so when you wish to use the controls in this project you would have to take out the files yourself. in future, I might try to turn this into a library but for now that's not the case. 

# Controls you may find

- ## Scrum Board
  the one that you see in Bitbucket. You define the columns with their titles, the item cards with title and summary and in which column they should appear. they can be dragged into another column. you can also define which columns the items cannnot move to.

- ## Horizontal Calendar
  it's much like a horizontally scrollable calendar that you often see in project managenebt tools where dats appear at the top and all the items appear below as list items. these can be dragged to change the date. check the roadmap of the JIRA for the understanding. 

- ## Regular Calendar
  much like what you see in Google calendar. check the google calendar to get the idea. 

## Libraries Used
- React
- Vite
